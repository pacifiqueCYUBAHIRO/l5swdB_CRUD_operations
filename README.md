Before you start coding, keep these core requirements from your "Integrated Situation" in mind:
1. Planning: Draw your ERD on paper first, ensuring all primary/foreign keys and cardinalities are clear.

2. Database:
 Create the PSSMS database with tables for ParkingSlot, Car, ParkingRecord, and Payment.

3. Backend:
 Build a Node.js/Express application with CRUD operations. Remember, passwords must be encrypted.

4. Frontend:
 Use React.js and Tailwind CSS. The UI must be responsive and include a session-based login.

5. Logic:
 Ensure the system calculates fees at
500 Rwf per hour
 and can generate both individual bills and daily sales reports.

:hammer_and_wrench: GitHub Submission Guidelines
When you're ready to share your project on GitHub, follow these steps to ensure your repository is clean and easy for your assessor to navigate.
1. Repository Structure
Your main folder should follow the required naming convention:
FirsPractical_Exam
. Inside that folder, separate your work:

•/backend-project
•/frontend-project
•README.md

2. Creating your README.md
A good
README.md is the "front door" of your project. Make sure it includes:
• Project Title: Parking Space Sales Management System (PSSMS).
Project Description: A brief overview of how the system helps SmartPark move from a manual to a digital system.

• Group Members: List all members of your group clearly.
• Tech Stack: Mention React.js, Node.js, Express, Tailwind CSS, and your chosen database (MySQL/MongoDB).
• Setup Instructions: Briefly explain how to run the backend and frontend (e.g., npm install and npm start).

3. Pushing to GitHub
Open your terminal in your main project folder and run these commands:

# Initialize the repository
git init

# Add all files (make sure to use a .gitignore for node_modules!)
git add .

# Create your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: PSSMS project structure and group details"

# Link to your GitHub repo
git remote add origin [YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL]

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
